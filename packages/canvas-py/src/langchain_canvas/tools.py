"""Standard canvas tools — the agent's hands on a persistent canvas.

Four file-level primitives over a :class:`~langchain_canvas.store.CanvasStore`:

- ``read_canvas``  — file content with line numbers + the current revision
- ``write_canvas`` — create or fully replace a file
- ``edit_canvas``  — replace one unique occurrence, **requires the revision
  returned by a prior read** (read-before-update enforced by the contract,
  not by prompt discipline)
- ``list_canvas_files`` — files currently on the canvas

The tools persist through the store **and** broadcast each committed ``.html``
change as wire events (``canvas.create``/``patch``/``commit``) through the
run's stream writer, so a connected client redraws live. Without a stream
writer (unit tests, plain scripts) the broadcast is a silent no-op — same
contract as :class:`~langchain_canvas.emitter.Canvas`. Which canvas they act
on is resolved per call: ``canvas_id`` in the runtime context (or
``configurable``), falling back to ``thread_id`` — by default a thread and
its canvas are the same scope.

Build them with :func:`create_canvas_tools`, which closes over your store::

    store = InMemoryCanvasStore()
    agent = create_canvas_agent(model, tools=create_canvas_tools(store))
